Iâ€™ve wanted to write for as long as I can remember but Iâ€™ve always felt like Iâ€™m not good enough, or that my thoughts are boring and not worth writing, or that itâ€™s pointless because nobody will want to read what Iâ€™m writing, or a bunch of other random reasons to be honest. Iâ€™ve talked myself out of it for so long that even now Iâ€™m more focused on what this blog looks like rather than what it says. Iâ€™ve been tinkering with the look of it for three days trying to find something that looks nice.

But here it is. Youâ€™re able to read it. Itâ€™s just text. And while I may not be 100% in love with how it looks right now I am happy with the fact that I was able to let that go and actually click *Publish*.

Iâ€™ve been through *a lot* these last few years and my life is supremely different now than it was the last time I published a blog post. Iâ€™ve experienced the highs and lows that come with working in the startup industry, been through orthodontic treatment and jaw surgery, lost my father, took a leap of faith and fell in love, branched outside of my comfort zone, Iâ€™m back playing hockey, and Iâ€™m learning to cherish experiences rather than possessions.

This blog is going to be an honest and, for the most part, unfiltered look into my life and experiences. An outlet, if you will. A way for me to say whatâ€™s been on my mind. A way to say the things that Iâ€™ve been too scared to let out. Youâ€™re welcome to come along for the ride and Iâ€™m happy to have you but I know now that first and foremost this needs to be for me and not for anyone else.

So here we go.
