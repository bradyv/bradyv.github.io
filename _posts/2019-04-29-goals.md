In years past my approach to *New Years Resolutions* has usually been to keep a rough mental list of some things I'd like to accomplish and then I would promptly forget about it all just a few weeks in.

This year I wanted to try something different &mdash; I wrote them down.

What I realized is that having a hard copy to reference made me more motivated to work towards accomplishing what I had written down, and having the ability to physically cross something off after completion gave me an extra sense of satisfaction to look forward to.

For 2019 this is what I wrote down for myself to accomplish.

* Save $6000
    * Ongoing - $1000/$6000
* ~~Visit somewhere new~~
    * Banff, AB, March 16, 2019
* Switch to a clean diet
* ~~Reach Diamond rank in Rocket League~~
    * January 3, 2019
* Hold Katharine's hand more
    * Ongoing
* Learn to drive
* Return to NYC
* Try 3 new foods
    * Cubano sandwich
* ~~Ship a personal project~~
    * The [Treemendous](https://treemendous.fm){: class="treemendous"} podcast, April 26, 2019
* Read 40 books
    * Ongoing - 14/40

As of writing I've completed 3/10 with four more in active progress.

There's a piece of wisdom I've heard while working with [Allen](https://twitter.com/apike) that has stuck with me and I'll paraphrase here:

> If we accomplish all of our goals we probably weren't ambitious enough

There's a tight balance between accomplishing too much and not accomplishing enough. I won't be satisfied if the year ends with me at 30% completion rate but I know that as long as I continue working towards them I'll be happy with the effort I gave.
