		<p>Wallflower was one of the original names proposed by the initial Perch team before they ultimately decided to use Perch. Earlier this year we had an idea to use it as a spin-off project and I was able to work on an app icon and branding concept.</p>

		<p>The idea was in my head as soon as I heard the name and I immediately went to work sketching out some ideas. The Wallflower icon went through many iterations both on paper and digitally before arriving at the final approved version.</p>
