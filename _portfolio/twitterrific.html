		<p>I've long been a user and supporter of Twitterrific and the entire team at The Iconfactory. I found myself frustrated at the current state of Twitter apps on Mac OS X so I took a stab at giving Twitterrific a fresh coat of paint to bring it in line with the iOS offering.</p>

		<p>I wanted to stick with the established Twitterrific aesthetic but also allow it to fit right at home on OS X Yosemite. It was important to include the features that are now standard such as timeline syncing, large image thumbnails, lists, and native retweeting. Twitterrific's now trademark themeing options were also important to include.</p>

		<p>While The Iconfactory currently has no plans to build an updated version of Twitterrific for Mac the redesign was seen by various members of their team who all showed love and support to new design.</p>
