			<h3>Interface design, web design, branding</h3>

		<p>In May 2016 I was brought on by Volta, and startup creating a game-changing online security platform the completely does away with the need for user passwords.</p>

		<p>My primary focus was the interface for their iOS app. They needed something that was clean, simple, and easy to use, with a focus on complete transparency towards the user. A service that handles your online security needs to be as forthcoming as possible and so we worked hard to find the best method for showing the user every piece of data that's being shared with their online services.</p>

		<p>Once we wrapped up the MVP design of the iOS app we switched gears to the branding. Originally known as SineOn, we played with various logo ideas relating to security, privacy, and passwords.</p>

		<p>Just as we were polishing a logo that was universally loved the company renamed from SineOn to Volta. The team agreed to keep the branding and simply switched the wordmark to read the new name.</p>
