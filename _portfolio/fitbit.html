			<h1>Fitbit for iOS 7</h1>
			<h3>Unsolicited redesign</h3>

		</div>

		<p>I started wearing a Fitbit tracker in 2013 when I was on an epic weight loss journey. The release of iOS 7 came and went but the Fitbit app sat without an update for what felt like an eternity so I spent some time mocking up what it might look like once the update was finally released. The update eventually came out while I was still working on these designs which is why they sit here unfinished.</p>

		<p>There's some elements in this mockup that I'd still like to see Fitbit take advantage of, namely the unified toolbar and navigation between days of activy. Having it as two separate elements, as it still exists in the current app, always felt unnecessary to me.</p>

		<p>I also loved the idea of different colours for different sections of the app. It's something I like to use wherever possible in projects to this day.</p>
