			<h3>Interface design, web design, icon design</h3>

		</div>

		<p>I joined Perch at the end of September 2013 to head up visual design primarily for the iOS app but also for web and marketing design.</p>

		<p>The Perch marketing site was in constant development once I was brought on board. We went through several minor iterations as new features were released but with a complete rewrite of the app in the works we knew that the entire site would need an overhaul. The process was long and collaborative. We went one page at a time, with the prime focus being to perfect the content and messaging above the fold on each major page.</p>

		<p>The biggest task of course was the iOS app, particularly the iPad version. Perch v3 was released a month before I joined the team and was a big departure from the previous direction of the app. There was a lot of UX issues with the product at the time and I took those on as my biggest priority from the start. My first big decision was to break apart the universal iOS app into a distinct iPad and iPhone version so that we could really focus on what we wanted each device to deliver. The iPad would be the dedicated portal device and the iPhone would act as a personal device to connect with available portals. The second big decision was to only support the newest version of iOS, which at the time was iOS 7. This let us ease design and development time by not having to design and build around legacy issues with previous versions of iOS.</p>
