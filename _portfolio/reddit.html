			<h1>What if reddit.com was beautiful?</h1>
			<h3>Unsolicited redesign</h3>

		<p>Reddit is one of my favourite websites to consume content but it has a very basic, dated, and at times confusing design. I've spent the last few years on and off doing various designs for a Reddit iOS app and decided that it was time for the web interface to get a facelift. I wanted to give it a more modern look and feel and make it a much more visual experience. A large part of Reddit is sharing photos and videos so I went with a more visual approach rather than the classic list of links.</p>
